# Facial-Recognition-app-using-MATLAB-signal-analysis

this project is submitted to EECS203-Signal Analysis course at faculty of engineering - Cairo university in Spring 2023 semester.


the main idea is analysing a sample of pictures for each person and Calculating the average vector of each person then comparing the test photo with the average vector to detect the person. 
it works by analysing the signal in time domain , I suggest using the frequency domain for better results.
